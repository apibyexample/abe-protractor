API By Example helper for Protractor
====================================

This repository includes tools to be able to use the [ABE format](https://github.com/apibyexample/abe-spec)
from within JS code. In particular we aim to support [Protractor JS](https://github.com/angular/protractor) tests.

## Usage

In order to use ``abe-protractor`` you will need to add the setup service stubs,
using Protractor's ``onPrepare`` within your protractor-conf file.

###Â mocksLocation

This is the location of your ABE mock files, in which to cycle through.

### stubsLocation

Type: ``String`` *Required*

This is the location in which your manually created Stubs are kept, the file locations should mirror those found within ``mocksLocation``.

### log

Type: ``Boolean`` Default: ``false``

This flags whether or not you wish ``abe-protractor`` to log out when stubs have been created during the setup of running Protractor tests.

Example folder structure ``(desc could be users)``:

```
mocks/                      -> Base of your Mock storage
    mock-desc               -> Your container for your Mock
        post.json           -> The POST example of your API Mock
        get.json            -> The GET of singular resources within response example of your API Mock
        put.json            -> The PUT example of your API Mock
        query.json          -> The GET of multiple resources within response example of your API Mock
stubs/
    stub-desc
        mock-desc.stub.js   -> Stub for your Mock
```

Example Usage:

```js
var abeProtractor = require('abe-protractor');

onPrepare: function () {
    abeProtractor.setupServiceStubs({
        mocksLocation: 'mocks/**/*',
        stubsLocation: 'stubs/',
        log: true
    });
}
```

It is expected that all of your ABE-Spec mocked JSON files are located in the same
folder (or at least the same parent folder).

### Do I have to make my stubs?

If you do not require any custom stubs you can use abe-protractor's default builder
for stubs. Using your mock JSON files it will create your stubs for you, based on the
information within your JSON spec.

To take a look at the stub that is generated take a look [here](src/abe-generate-stub.js).
